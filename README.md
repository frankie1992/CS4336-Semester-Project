Description:

In this project you will create a web application for a movie theater.


Application requirements:

  1. List theaters for a zipcode.
  2. List movies for a theater.
  3. View description of a movie.
  4. List times for a movie.
  5. Purchase tickets for a movie time.
     Assumptions:
       Infinite seats.
       Each ticket is $10.
       Payment system is simulated (no real payment system).
       All card charges are approved.
  6. Validations:
       Zipcode - 5 digits
       Credit card - 16 digits



Infrastructure requirements:

   Web:  JSF preferred, JSP or Servlets permitted.
   Database: EJB/JPA preferred, EJB/JDBC permitted.


Design:

The web interface is for you to design, and it should be easy to use and offer more than plain text for its appearance.  This should include the use of styles and images.  It should be suitable to demo to a company as an example of your work.

You should also create two diagrams:
 1) System Architecture, showing the 4 tiers and which major pieces of your system are in each tier.
    This can be similar to Figure 1-1 in the Java EE Overview slides.  Consider this as an abstract view, for example, if you have several JSF files, they can all be represented with one box labeled JSF.

 2) Software Architecture, showing the main software pieces of your project and how they relate.  
    This can be similar to the first diagram but it should be at a lower level, for example, which JSF pages use which beans.


Code:

A working system should be created (with a simulated payment system).  The code should be easy to read, and comments should be used to guide the reader.
